I developed a Netflix clone project as a showcase of my programming skills in Swift, utilizing the UIKit for the front-end design to create an intuitive and engaging user interface. This application taps into the Movie Database API to fetch and display an array of movie titles and trailers, providing users with an immersive entertainment experience. It features dynamic, scrollable tabs that categorize content into 'Top Rated', 'Most Popular', and 'Trending TV', allowing users to effortlessly navigate through the platform to find their desired content. Additionally, the project includes a search section that enables quick and easy access to the extensive movie library. This Netflix clone stands as a testament to the capabilities of modern iOS app development, offering a seamless and user-friendly platform for movie enthusiasts.
